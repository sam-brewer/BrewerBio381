**Question 3**

```
Original:

0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3 0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3 0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3 0004 Walking Cane.mp3

New:

0001 Georgia Horseshoe.mp3
0002 Billy In The Lowground.mp3
0003 Cherokee Shuffle.mp3
0004 Walking Cane.mp3

How I did it:

I want to convert the space following each song's file name to a new line, so I searched for the captured phrase (mp3) followed by `\s` to indicate the space and replaces it with \1\r to move each captured portion to a new line
